This is a list of mods for Apoc 1.16.5 Generation 3 for Testing, A.K.A. A116G3T or ApocSimpGen.

## Notice

Important note, along with these mods, you must have "BetterEnd Reforked" for 1.16.5 on Forge. 
I, unfortunately, was not able to add the mod to the list because of GitHub's 25mb upload limit.
